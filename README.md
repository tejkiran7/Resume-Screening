# Resume Screening Application

This project is a resume screening application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models to analyze and evaluate resumes. The application is built using the Streamlit framework, which allows for the creation of interactive web applications directly from Python scripts.

## Features

- **Resume Analysis**: The application uses NLP techniques to extract relevant information from resumes, such as work experience, skills, education, and other relevant details.
- **Resume Scoring**: Machine learning models are employed to score and rank resumes based on predefined criteria, such as job requirements, desired skills, and experience.
- **User Interface**: The Streamlit framework provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for uploading resumes, configuring screening criteria, and viewing the results.
